# AIAgent
An AI agent using LLMs and has a built in UI, there is another Agent template designed for e-Commerce.

## App.py
Used python as it is the most reliable for LLM technologies, I used openai library to be able to respond to user inputs. This AI agent isnt very optimal for e-commerce as I didn't tune the agent, however, I did tune the AI Agent for main.py but was unable to connect the UI due to time conflicts. I used streamlit (python library) as the UI for saving time as well because it is in python and made it a simple agent UI with chatbot history which can be saved and deletion history too. If alloted more time I would use react/js to build the application or .NET. The requirements.txt is for the main.py agent created that can be run with 'python main.py' or 'python .\main.py' which you can see would be catered more towards the e-commerce requirement.
